        <ul><li>She cofounded the company Higher Order Software in 1976 and established Hamilton Technologies 10 years later.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>
            In the early 1960s Hamilton joined MITâ€™s Lincoln Laboratory, where she was involved in the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) project, the first U.S. air defense system. 
            She notably wrote software for a program to identify enemy aircraft.
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>
            She led a team that was tasked with developing the software for the guidance and control systems of the in-flight command and lunar modules of the Apollo missions. At the time, no schools taught software engineering, so the team members had to work out any problems on their own. She coined the term software engineer because she felt that the work she and her team were doing was just as important and just as much engineering as the other work on the Apollo spacecraft.
        </li></ul>
        <ul><li>
            Hamilton herself specifically concentrated on software to detect system errors and to recover information in a computer crash. Both those elements were crucial during the Apollo 11 mission (1969), which took astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the Moon.
